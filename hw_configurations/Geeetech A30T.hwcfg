## What command to use for controlling nozzle temperature. M104 and G10 supported

## Z-hop when moving to and from the tower. Used with slicers (Cura) that do not provide settings in gcode files.

## Extruder motor current values. Adjusts motor current using M907. Values are 
## for load/unload and for normal operation.

## Prepurge means the fast purge movements that purge old material before tool change
## - temperature = change temperature of the nozzle this amount before doing the prepurge. Negative value lowers the temperature
## - length = length of one sweep
## - extrusion.length = how much material to extrude per sweep
## - speed = how fast to move in one sweep
## - count = how many sweeps
## - gap = distance to next sweep line
prepurge.temperature.change: -10
prepurge.sweep.length: 50
prepurge.sweep.extrusion.length: 4.5
prepurge.sweep.speed: 3000
prepurge.sweep.count: 4

## Prime extruders
## Change next line to True to enable

## Use this to fine tune filament position after preprime. Neagtive values retract
prerun.finetune.length: 5

## Rapid retract means pulling the filament out of the nozzle.
## Various stages can be defined.
## - initial retract happens right after prepurge is done
## length and speed are self explanatory
## pause = how long to let filament cool in throat (ms)
## long retract = pulling filament fully out of way

rapid.retract.initial[0].length: 25
rapid.retract.initial[0].speed: 1500
rapid.retract.initial[1].length: 15
rapid.retract.initial[1].speed: 1500
rapid.retract.pause: 2000
rapid.retract.long[0].length: 145
rapid.retract.long[0].speed: 1500

## After tool change, feed new filament
## Use one or more stages (array). Feeding is recommended to do in different speeds:
## - start relatively slow
## - ramp up the speed for the main length of the feed
## - slow down for the last bit for smoother insert

feed[0].length: 10
feed[0].speed: 1500
feed[1].length: 145
feed[1].speed: 2000
feed[2].length: 20
feed[2].speed: 1500

## Do X movement during feeding to prevent blobs
## Change next line to True to enable
feed.trail: True

## prime trail is the first extrusion after filament is almost fully fed to the nozzle.
## Might be useful for clearing old filament if extruding bit more than normally
prime.trail.extrusion.length: 5
prime.trail.speed: 900

## Tower coasting length. Use to even out the extrusion after tower if there's over-extrusion seen.
