## Hint: [0] means array of values ([0], [1], [2]...)

## Temperature handling
## use_id: should M104 commands have tool id. M104 S210 or M104 S210 T1. Firmware dependent
tool.temperature.use_id:  False

## Extruder motor current values. Adjusts motor current using M907. Values are 
## for load/unload and for normal operation.
## load = motor current for load/unload
## run = motor current for normal operation
## These can be set to 0 if not applicable

## These prepurge steps are executed before the actual prepurge. They seem to help with tip formation on some cases

## Prepurge means the fast purge movements that purge old material before tool change
## - temperature = change temperature of the nozzle this amount before doing the prepurge. Negative value lowers the temperature
## - length = length of one sweep
## - extrusion.length = how much material to extrude per sweep
## - speed = how fast to move in one sweep
## - count = how many sweeps
## - gap = distance to next sweep line

prepurge.sweep.length: 50
prepurge.sweep.extrusion.length: 4

## Rapid retract means pulling the filament out of the nozzle.
## Various stages can be defined.
## - initial retract happens right after prepurge is done
## length and speed are self explanatory
## wipe = do wipe movements during retracts to reduce oozing
## pause = how long to let filament cool in throat (ms)
## long retract = pulling filament fully out of way

rapid.retract.initial[0].speed: 2700
rapid.retract.wipe: True

## Various filament cooling movements after major retract. Uncomment to enable. Make sure that there are even amount
## of cooling movements and the total length is 0

## After tool change, feed new filament
## Use one or more stages (array). Feeding is recommended to do in different speeds:
## - start relatively slow
## - ramp up the speed for the main length of the feed
## - slow down for the last bit for smoother insert

feed[0].length:   5
feed[0].speed: 1500
feed[1].length:  15
feed[1].speed: 2700
feed[2].length:   9
feed[2].speed: 1500

## Do X movement during feeding to prevent blobs
## Change next line to True to enable
feed.trail: True

## prime trail is the first extrusion after filament is almost fully fed to the nozzle.
## Might be useful for clearing old filament if extruding bit more than normally
prime.trail.extrusion.length: 5
prime.trail.speed: 900

## Tower coasting length. Use to even out the extrusion after tower if there's over-extrusion seen.
